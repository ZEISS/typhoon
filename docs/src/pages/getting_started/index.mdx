# How it works

Typhoon is a cloud-native technology that help you to receive, filter, transform, route and deliver events
across a wide-range of sources and targets.

```mermaid
graph TD

subgraph SRC [Event Sources]
    A[SaaS apps]
    B[Microservices]
    C[Custom apps]
end

subgraph DEST [Targets]
    direction RL
    E[Webhook]
    F[API destination]
    G[Service targets]
end

subgraph Z [Typhoon]
    direction RL
    subgraph X [Event Bus]
         direction RL
        H[Default event bus]
        I[Custom event bus]
    end
    R[Rules]
end

H --> R;
A --> H;
B --> H;
C --> H;
R --> E;
R --> F;
R --> G;
```

# Use cases

## Application integration

Send events from on-premises applications to the cloud and back and use the events to build new applications.

## IT Automation

Use events to automate your infrastructure for validating configurations, monitoring, and alerting.
Audit user behavior, or remediate security incidents.

## SaaS Integrations

Receive events from your SaaS applications, like Salesforce or ServiceNow, enrich your data,
