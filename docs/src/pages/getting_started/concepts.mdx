Typhoon is a cloud-native eventing platform that enables you to
bridge events between sources and targets and in-between transform
these events.

There are various needed concepts to achieve this bridging.

* [Events](#events)
* [Sources](#sources)
* [Targets](#targets)
* [Transformations](#transformations)
* [Flow](#flow)

## Events

An event is a common format of data that can be exchanged between sources and targets.

Typhoon is using [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io) as the event format.
Typhoon supports the JSON format of CloudEvents and uses the[HTTP protocol binding](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/bindings/http-protocol-binding.md)

The format of a CloudEvent is as follows:

```json
{
    "specversion" : "1.0",
    "type" : "com.github.pull_request.opened",
    "source" : "https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/pull",
    "subject" : "123",
    "id" : "A234-1234-1234",
    "time" : "2018-04-05T17:31:00Z",
    "comexampleextension1" : "value",
    "comexampleothervalue" : 5,
    "datacontenttype" : "text/xml",
    "data" : "<much wow=\"xml\"/>"
}
```

The data can be processed via the availble [CloudEvents SDKs](https://cloudevents.io/).
Because this is an agnostic format, it can be used to transport all kind of data without
the need to preemtively define the data structure.

## Sources 

Sources are the origin of events. These maybe created in any environment in which
Typhoon is deployed in. This can be on-premise on in the public cloud.
[NATS.io](https://nats.io) can be run in any of these environments.

All sources are listed and documented in the [Sources](/sources) section.

## Targets

Targets are the destination of events. Usually any source is also a target or vise versa.

Not all targets behave the same way. Some targets only acknowledge to receive the event,
but only later process the event data. Others provide additional information about the
event processing, which actually creates a response event.

All targets are listed and documented in the [Targets](/targets) section.

## Transformations

Transformations are the in-between processing of events. This can be a simple Transformations
like adding annotations to the event or a more complex transformation like changing the event
structure or format.

All transformations are listed and documented in the [Transformations](/transformations) section.
