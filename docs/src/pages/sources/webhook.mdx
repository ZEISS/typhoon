title: Webhook Source (HTTP)
---

The source exposes an HTTP endpoint. This endpoint can be used to virtually
integrate with any 3rd-party system. It is a generic way to ingest events via HTTP.

Every request will create an event.

The webhook can receive arbitrary data that is wrapped in a [CloudEvent](https://cloudevents.io/) envelope.
